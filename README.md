# TidyTuesday

## About

Taken directly from the [R For Data Science](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) TidyTuesday README:

> A weekly data project geared toward the R community. Because this project grew out of the R4DS Online Learning Community and the R for Data Science textbook, an emphasis was made on learning how to summarize and arrange data to create meaningful charts using ggplot2, tidyr, dplyr, and other tidyverse ecosystem tools. Any code-based methodology is welcome, as long as the code used to obtain the insights is shared.

## Sub-Repositories

I've categorized the code for graphics based on year. You can find code notebooks and more visuals in the sub repositories listed below. Within these folders, you will find code organized by week (e.g. Wk1, Wk2, etc).
